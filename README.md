# Final-Project-CSC-101-07
Python program that focuses on household energy consumption datasets within the community of San Luis Obispo County. 


# ***Chosen dataset/theme***

Our chosen dataset is a country average of household energy consumption of over 12,000 households, over a week period from April 1st, 2025, to April 7th, 2025. Each household contains a unique ID number.  There are over 70,000 lines of data. Each line has 7 pieces of data: the household ID, the date, the total energy consumption that day, the household size, average external temperature in Celsius, whether they have AC or not, and their usage during peak hours.  

Each household ID has seven dates/ 7 lines of data related to that household. 

 

# *Problem statement*

The United States is in its current state. Virtually every single house across the United States has access to an electrical utility or some type of energy source. According to World Bank data, 100% of the U.S. has access to electricity as of 2023. But how many individuals are mindful of their electrical use? From personal experience, I, and many people that I know, tend to leave a light on after they leave a room, or accidentally leave their desktop running while they’re away for the day. How does that add up on a larger scale? Even if one out of eight people leaves a light on when they leave a light on in a room, how does that add up across the country, where everyone has access and uses electricity/energy? For it’s an important question to ask. As computer scientists with an elevated understanding of computing, we can be socially responsible to check the data, recognize patterns. and make changes based on the data that we collect. Making ourselves more aware, vigilant, and mindful about how we use our privilege throughout our country.
